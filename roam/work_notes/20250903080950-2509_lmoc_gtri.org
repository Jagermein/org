*** Way for other applciations can be used to get data
*** Has a cross-domain solution
*** Common Operating Picture (COP)
*** service based
*** TSPI providers
**** Can also take radar to make tspi
*** FUZE track, can provide the best source to that track
**** QUESTION : what is considered best source
*** PRISM : Multi level security solution
*** LUCI : Line Up Information Card
*** RITA : Real Time Analysis 'Shot Sheet'
*** BLAST : Used to get data form DIS
*** DOTT : Data Object Transformation Tool
** LMOC VMs
*** Went over the VMs lightly. Each VM is like a service?
** QUESTION : When they are flying events, how does it know when events are? do you need to start/stop it?

* LMOC v1.7
** RTO functions will be containerized within one event/mission
** TSPI data is nasty sometimes

* RAPID Req
** PRISM status with our Markers
*** How/what is needed for us to push Markers to their DB with PRISM in mind.
**** QUESTION : What is needed or the PRISM aware marker?
** One thing that was coming up was the fact on what are we going to share.
*** This comes into if we are placing into their DB or if they are grabbing things from us.
*** This is a bigger quesiton with Bob and I don't believe we will be giving, but they can get it via sharing.
*** QUESTION : If we are sharing what is to stop them from just grabbing it. We want to play and integrate but what is too much

* DB Structure talking
** Talks about TENA, and making DB efficient?
*** Unsure what is truly being talked about.
*** Are they talking about the DB efficiency of a DB read/write or what
*** They are talking about TENA storing everything, and also how to integrate the data that is *not* TENA data objects?
*** SQL is being talked about and stuff
*** POSTGRES with JSON streamer
*** Using MetaData to speed up the querying
*** Time to Create to create the briefing db
*** looking for a commitment to aid with the DB
*** Recording Live data, messy then clean it up afterwards for getting data
*** They are talking about other things such as how to make it quick and the correct data?

* Talking about DB Structures
** They are talking about pushing RAPID stuff
*** I do not think we are pushing to the DB ever?
** Taking data via DOTT or something else?
** QUESTION : What is TIDE and Flyout Source
** TIDE : Being used as a service broker? Still unsure what this is actually doing
*** TIDE handling the piecemill
** TIDE handling the verisoning and tagging
** ARCADB is mainly used for PRISM and a multi-level security system
*** This is mainly used at a high lievel to access data, and the context allows the users to be unaware of the other data that is within there
*** Likely what I was thinking about, but it is going to be context on the security rather than the type of data

* ARCADB / TIDE/ Talking
** TIDE
*** Will be a data broker to the ARCADB
*** PRISM 1.5 for LMOC 1.7
