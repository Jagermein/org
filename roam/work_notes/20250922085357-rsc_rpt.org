* Question for 250923 Meeting
** [[id:12137b1c-57e4-44e8-93f1-260ad7133543][Gradesheet]]
*** What you think the ask is (ideas/concepts would be helpful)
**** To create a user defined [[id:12137b1c-57e4-44e8-93f1-260ad7133543][Gradesheet]].
**** This needs to be able to be nearly 100% customizable
**** Ability ot choose num/denom
**** Be more than a reporting tool
***** Ability to dive into stats easily to help epxlain the 'whys'
**** Exportable data
***** PDF/Excel formatting. Excel 4 their own viz, PDF for ours
**** Dataset query
*** How you think you will accomplish the initiative (include multiple COAs if appropriate)
**** MVP
***** Numerator Demoninator choice
***** Customizable field additions
***** Ability to move around the 'metrics'
***** Dataset addiiton
**** Phase 1
***** Diving into the 'why'
***** Picking the metric, and expandables that dive into the stats
**** Phase 2
***** More indepth metrics.
***** NTA/Skills/MOE/MOP
***** 'Possible' Adding 'math' into the metrics
****** QUESTION : 'math' needs to be though about. LIkely is meaning something along the lines more of logic within the metric itself? More of an || && type of thing rather than a + - x / type of math.
**** Phase 3+
***** TBD, as time proceeds and more ideas flush through.
*** Estimated time to complete the initiative
**** MVP - 1-2 months (err on the side of 2)
**** Phase 1 - early 2026
**** Phase 3 - Unsure with a few of the metrics. Can estimate Q2 2026?
*** What resources you need to start work on the initiative
**** None to start.
**** For Phase 3, there will be a lot of collaboration with the WSD and Analytics team. This is mainly for how rigorous and built up the MOE/MOP/NTA/Skills are. Talking with Puffy, currently they are more mature than i initially thought. But we need to get a plan of attack in order to make sure it is flushed out.
*** Questions you have that preclude answers to the above
**** N/A

** [[id:07a03fb5-859b-43bd-aa51-e05946941e9a][Dashboard]]
*** What you think the ask is (ideas/concepts would be helpful)
**** to create a user defined dashbaord that a user can define the layout.
**** Also to be able ot create user defined plots, with a preview
**** Plots to be able ot be used throughout RAPID
**** Have it similar to what BI tools are, but for RAPID users
***** This means easier to use, and more tailored experience so there is a smaller learning curve.
*** How you think you will accomplish the initiative (include multiple COAs if appropriate)
**** MVP is completed
***** MVp included the ability to create the dashboad and custom plots.
**** Phase 1 is underway
***** More plots to be able to be used
***** Also ability for more customizaiton with the plots
**** Phase 2 is TBD
*** Estimated time to complete the initiative
**** Mostly completed
**** Phase 1+ is underway. Plots include Bubble, Heatmap, Contours.
***** Phase 1+ also includes imporoved filtering for dropdowns
***** What is needed here is more understanding on the databases/marker structure. Which I am getting from Standards via Andy.
