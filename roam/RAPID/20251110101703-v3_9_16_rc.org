* Bugs
** Dashboard
*** Bug 1:
- Recreation steps
  - Open a new dashabord
  - Create a plot (or use existing)
  - Remove plot
  - Change dataset
  - Last added plot will repopulate in dashboard
- Potential fixes
  - Likely a stale state
  - Try to see if I am reading in via Redux or some other method
  - Also can be issue with removing plots function. Need to update redux and the use redux for all Dashboards?
- Scripts that are impacted
  - Likely just in Dashboard and PlotGrid.
*** QOL 1:
- Console logging on plot changes (ie config)
- FIX : remove the logging
*** Bug 2:
- Recreation steps
  - Create just ONE plot
  - Click on plot but do not add
  - Delete said plot
  - Plot will persist in the drop down
- Potential fixes
  - Likely default value upon deletion needs to be reset
  - Not sure why this is happening with just one plot
*** QOL 2:
- Modify tooltip is persisting for some reason
*** QOL 3:
- Adding the type of plots within the Modify plot window



* Notes
** Look into Gradesheet deletion workflow.
- the workflow should be where if it is deleted it should prompt user the field where they need to chose GS
- Right now I am unsure if this is just defaulting to Zero index or if it actually going to something elese?
** Looki into exporting GS in PDF and PNG
- This likley is a Candice issue, but for something later.
** Database coloring was off in Candice DB
- Unsure where this is happening. On my branch it is working, so unsure if it was the DB that we were working with.
- My actual DB and branch was working in a way where we are actually forcing it.
