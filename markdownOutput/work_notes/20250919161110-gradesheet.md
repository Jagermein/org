### The amin objective is tpo be able to report data based on datasets. This differs from the dashboard in a few ways. The dashbaord give similar dat, but is less user definable. As in the [Gradesheet](20250919161110-gradesheet.md) is able to specify various fields on from the markers. BUT this can also give insights based on certain fields as well.

### These user specified fields, allow users to (for MVP) choose the numerator and the denominator for form the markers. Now these are base don either Marker&rsquo;s as a whole or the fields within.

1.  Issues for MVP, we cannot have cross-domain marker fields. (ie no AIM-120 v AIM-9 markers).

2.  The issues above will be able to occur but i need to think about this in more depth to see the logic that would bet allow for this comparison.
