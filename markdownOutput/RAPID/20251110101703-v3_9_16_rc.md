# Bugs


<a id="org54d4d76"></a>

## Dashboard


<a id="org3e234f7"></a>

### Bug 1:

-   Recreation steps
    -   Open a new dashabord
    -   Create a plot (or use existing)
    -   Remove plot
    -   Change dataset
    -   Last added plot will repopulate in dashboard
-   Potential fixes
    -   Likely a stale state
    -   Try to see if I am reading in via Redux or some other method
    -   Also can be issue with removing plots function. Need to update redux and the use redux for all Dashboards?
-   Scripts that are impacted
    -   Likely just in Dashboard and PlotGrid.

### QOL 1:

-   Console logging on plot changes (ie config)
-   FIX : remove the logging


<a id="org6e00958"></a>

### Bug 2:

-   Recreation steps
    -   Create just ONE plot
    -   Click on plot but do not add
    -   Delete said plot
    -   Plot will persist in the drop down
-   Potential fixes
    -   Likely default value upon deletion needs to be reset
    -   Not sure why this is happening with just one plot


<a id="orgcdbbf47"></a>

### QOL 2:

-   Modify tooltip is persisting for some reason


<a id="orgdd02ad8"></a>

### QOL 3:

-   Adding the type of plots within the Modify plot window

# Notes


<a id="org3284c45"></a>

## Look into Gradesheet deletion workflow.

-   the workflow should be where if it is deleted it should prompt user the field where they need to chose GS
-   Right now I am unsure if this is just defaulting to Zero index or if it actually going to something elese?


<a id="org93f4bc7"></a>

## Looki into exporting GS in PDF and PNG

-   This likley is a Candice issue, but for something later.


<a id="org72b7aac"></a>

## Database coloring was off in Candice DB

-   Unsure where this is happening. On my branch it is working, so unsure if it was the DB that we were working with.
-   My actual DB and branch was working in a way where we are actually forcing it.

## working on bar plot

-   working with bin #&rsquo;s or also numerical values right now.
